                    Student ID: 3125850
                    Bachelor of Science with Honours in Computer Science|
My name is Teniola Toluwani OLayide Adeyemi. I’m focused on becoming a software engineer, and I’ve been building my
                    foundation through online learning in data structures and algorithms, web development . I’ve built several projects
                    using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and APIs, and I’m currently Working on an AI project Right now, I’m aiming to
                    study Computer Science at the university of east London so I can take my technical abilities to the next level and work
                    on building scalable systems that Impact millions of people at Microsoft or Meta, where I can grow as an engineer and
                    contribute to meaningful products.

            <h3 class="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-purple-700">Why Computer Science?</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                I chose to study Computer Science because I wanted a deeper understanding of the concepts behind programming, Machine
                learning, and software development, which I strongly believe is important for building real-world software and AI
                systems. Over the past 3 months, I’ve been building a strong foundation through online learning studying data
                structures, algorithms, as well as web development and I’ve applied these skills in several projects hosted on Github,
                and I’m currently developing an AI web app, which has given me hands-on experience in AI API’s and real-world
                application of coding principles.
                
                Although self-study has taught me alot, I’ve realised that to truly live up to my expectations, I would need a
                structured, formal education that teaches not just practical skills, but also the theoretical concepts, computational
                thinking, and problem-solving approaches and after reviewing the modules for computer science on UEL’s website I knew
                modules like Advanced Programming, Algorithm Design, and Artificial Intelligence offered in the Computer Science program
                will fill the gaps in my knowledge and allow me to approach complex problems more systematically and efficientally.
                I’m also moved by the collaborative and innovative environment that the university provides. Working alongside peers
                from diverse backgrounds, learning from experienced lecturers, and taking on challenging projects in a structured
                academic setting will prepare me to lead and develop advanced software systems in the future. All in all, Computer
                Science is the perfect course for me because it combines theory and innovation — all of which are essential for turning
                ideas into impactful, real-world solutions.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                The Course is accredited by the British Computer Society (BCS), meaning their qualification is recognised
                internationally.
                The Lecturers who teach this course also had, a high percentage of students rating their teaching quality positively in
                2025
                In fact it was so high that in that same survey, the overall “student positivity” rating placed UEL 2nd in London, 4th
                in England, and 7th in the UK overall, with an 98% positivity rate.
                And in the 2025 National Student Survey (NSS), UEL’s computing courses were rated 1st in London according to Assessment
                and Feedback.
                
                
                And after a lot of thorough research I knew it was a wise decision to study computer science at UEL because it is a
                credible, high-quality choice for studying This course.

                21 in total

                CHALLENGES:
                However, after reviewing UEL’s comp sci modules I saw areas where I lacked in depth knowledge like high level abstract
                thinking for Advanced programming and the mathematical approaches behind machine learning models. These are topics and
                concepts that I could not really grasp on my own and I knew that I would need help from lecturers and classmates.

                TO OVERCOME COURSE CHALLENGES
                For me to overcome these challenges, what I do in most cases is apply the first principles thinking which is breaking
                down problems into its fundamental truths and building up from there and I would also break down difficult tasks into
                manageable parts and dedicate focused time to each, so that the workload doesn’t feel overwhelming. Then I would t
                review the course materials carefully, do a lot of practice problems, and watch alot tutorials to strengthen my
                understanding. I would also seek help from lecturers, tutors, and classmates and if I still encounter difficulties,
                discussing problems often clarifies things and has helped me a lot in most cases. And most especially, I would apply
                every little concept I learn to small projects and coding exercises, because hands-on practice helps me internalize
                complex ideas. By combining independent study, collaboration, and practical application, I am confident that I could
                overcome difficult challenges. Because I believe with time results and skills get better and better with effort.

                Assessment Approach:
                I will be assessed through a series of coursework, programming labs, group projects, examinations, and final-year
                project. The final-year projects are the most appealing to me because it allows me to conceptualise, design, and
                implement a fully functional system, applying everything that I have learnt and seeing how different components come
                together

                The UK education system is widely recognised for its high-quality teaching and globally respected degrees and it is
                backed by official government evaluations and international rankings.
                EVIDENCE
                • The British Council, an official UK government-linked organisation, states that UK degrees are “internationally
                recognised” and respected by employers globally.
                (Source: British Council – “Why Study in the UK?”)
                • It consistently ranks among the top countries for teaching excellence.
                • Many universities are rated highly for teaching in the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF), an official UK government
                evaluation.
                • The British Council reports that UK graduates are “among the most employable in the world”, and that a UK degree gives
                students a competitive edge in the global job market.
                (Source: British Council)
                • Official UK education guidance states that most UK bachelor’s degrees take 3 years, and master’s degrees often take 1
                year, allowing students to graduate faster.
                (Source: Study UK – UK Government campaign)
                • The official UK Government’s immigration guidelines confirm the Graduate Route, allowing international graduates to
                stay for 2 years (3 years for PhD).
                (Source: UK Government – GOV.UK)
                • It consistently ranked top-3 globally for research output and impact.
                (Source: Research Excellence Framework — official UK research assessment)
                • The British Council highlights that the UK welcomes over 600,000+ international students each year, making it one of
                the most diverse learning environments globally.
                • The flight time between Nigeria and London is – roughly about 6 to 7 hours which is relatively shorter as compared to
                other countries.
                ________________________________________
                EXPLANATION
                Their education qaulity is globally and professionally recognised.
                Because degrees are shorter, globally respected, and supported by strong teaching quality, you graduate sooner and with
                qualifications that employers understand worldwide.
                The Graduate Route also means you can gain work experience after your degree, making it easier to build a career in
                tech, AI, or software engineering.
                Altogether, this makes the UK one of the most advantageous destinations for ambitious students — especially in Computer
                Science and AI, where strong research, industry partnerships, and high teaching quality matter.

                My plan is to secure internships through UEL’s Career Zone, gaining hands-on experience in web development and AI
                projects and other aspects of software engineering. I also plan to work closely with experienced engineers so I can
                improve my skills faster and build a strong technical foundation in the industry.
                Early Career:
                After graduating, I aim to enter the workforce as a Backend Engineer at a major tech company such as Microsoft, with a
                starting salary between £25,000–£40,000, which is about ₦48,750,000 – ₦78,000,000. This is a realistic range for
                early-career engineers in London.
                Long-Term Goals:
                Over time, I intend to progress to mid-level and senior engineering roles. With the technical expertise and business
                experience I gain, my goal is to eventually establish an AI-driven tech start-up specializing in innovative web and
                enterprise solutions.
                Point:
                Overall, my career plan is clearly defined, connecting my studies, early work experience, and long-term entrepreneurial
                ambitions in a structured pathway.
                Evidence:
                As I advance, I plan to move into mid-level and senior engineering positions and eventually co-found an AI-driven tech
                startup, leveraging the expertise and professional network I develop in the UK.
                Explanation:
                Internships will give me hands-on experience and help me validate my developing skills. Full-time work will provide
                industry exposure and financial stability. Finally, founding a startup will allow me to apply everything I’ve learned in
                a meaningful way and potentially contribute to building innovative AI-driven solutions.

                If I could change one law in the UK, I would strengthen and modernise digital safety laws for young people—specifically
                around protecting minors from harmful online content, data misuse, and AI-generated misinformation Why this law? Young
                people today spend a lot of time online. Technology grows faster than existing laws. There are increasing concerns about
                privacy, online bullying, scams, and unsafe algorithms. What the new law would do: Stricter rules on how apps handle
                young people’s data. Clearer consequences for platforms that allow harmful or misleading content targeted at minors.
                More transparency on how recommendation algorithms work. Better education in schools about digital safety and critical
                thinking.

                TI have completed online learning in Data Structures & Algorithms, Full-Stack Web Development and have undertaken
                personal coding projects. This preparation allows me to transition immediately into a structured university program
                without losing momentum. Starting now ensures that my prior knowledge is reinforced in a formal academic setting, and I
                can immediately begin applying it to real-world projects and internships as well as I am financially and mentally
                prepared for university studies.
